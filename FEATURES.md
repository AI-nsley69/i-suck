## Flyhack
Gives you creative fly, will drop you down slightly every once in a while to prevent vanilla anticheat from kicking you, but will attempt at recovering height if you're not flying up/down.

Be extra careful when landing, current implementation makes you take a lot of fly damage. Recommended to fly still for a few seconds before landing.

Flying up for a longer time (3-4 seconds) can still get you kicked.

Boosted fly speed by 50% and flying up is faster by ~30% ontop of the existing fly boost.

## AutoFishing
